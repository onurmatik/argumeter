# Argumeter

**Argumeter** is a FastAPI-based application that takes a discussion thread as input and evaluates the arguments of the participants. It assigns an overall score to each user, identifies the facts supporting their arguments, and highlights any logical fallacies present.

## Features

- Accepts a discussion thread as input via a web form.
- Analyzes each user's arguments.
- Assigns an overall score to each user (on a scale of 1-10).
- Identifies supporting facts for each argument.
- Highlights any logical fallacies in the arguments.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building the app.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for argument evaluation and scoring.
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for rendering HTML pages.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic frontend for the web form.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for serving the FastAPI app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onurmatik/argumeter.git
   cd argumeter
