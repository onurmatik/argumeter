Alice:
Renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change. Solar and wind power generate electricity without emitting carbon dioxide, which is one of the leading causes of global warming.

Bob:
Renewable energy is too expensive and unreliable. Fossil fuels are still the best option for meeting global energy needs.

Alice:
Actually, the cost of renewable energy has dropped significantly over the past decade. Many countries are now adopting solar and wind because they are cost-competitive with fossil fuels.

Bob:
But what about the jobs that will be lost in the fossil fuel industry? Switching to renewable energy could devastate communities that rely on coal and oil for employment.

Alice:
Thatâ€™s a valid concern, but governments and companies can invest in retraining programs to help workers transition into new jobs in the renewable energy sector. Studies show that renewable energy creates more jobs per dollar invested than fossil fuels.
